Machine Name module
-------------------

This Module defines a machine name field type, relying on Form API's #type
'machine_name'.

This module was initially created for the D7 version of the project "project"
used by drupal.org itself: http://drupal.org/project/project
Because of the D7 update of drupal.org a stable version of this module was
needed: http://drupal.org/node/164790
This is the reason for a "special stable version" 7.x-1.0

The module can be used by everybody outside the drupal.org website. Maybe there
are some limitations. Please take a look at module issues:
http://drupal.org/project/issues/machine_name
Feel free to file an issue for reporting any problems and questions.

Further development will be done in the 7.x-2.x branch.
