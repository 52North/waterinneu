How do I use this?

Enable OG, create your Group node content type.

Then either use the default Thread bundle or create a new "Group Thread" bundle here:
admin/harmony/structure/thread

Then add the “Group audience” field so that the Thread can be linked to the Organic Group.
admin/config/group/fields


Enabled the module, make sure that your Group entity type has the "Group visibility" field which can be added here:
admin/config/group/fields

The access records will need to be rebuilt, following that
