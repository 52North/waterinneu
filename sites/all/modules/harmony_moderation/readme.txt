This module started out as a copy of flag_abuse in effect but for Harmony entities. Credit should be directed that way!

Further features include a report threshold whereby after a defined number of reports of a particular post it is automatically unpublished.

In addition there’s also flood control to limit the amount of reporting a single person can do in a defined amount of time.

Installation:
You’ll need to set permissions for flagging but that’s about it, further configuration can be found at: Structure > Flags > Harmony abuse flags.
