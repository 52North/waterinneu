					The primary goal of the WaterInnEU Portal is to facilitate 
					matchmaking between organizations offering products which 
					are relevant to river basin management, the potential users 
					of these products, and service providers (consultants, 
					researchers, NGOs etc.) which can support implementation 
					(for example via adaptation of software for use in a 
					specific river basin).
				</p>
				<p>
					The platform therefore aims to enhance communication between
					these stakeholders in order to ensure that the appropriate 
					products and services are implemented as quickly and 
					effectively as possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					Go to the <a href="matchmaking">Matchmaking</a> tab to put in an automatic service 
					request or offer, or to contact one of our experts for 
					bespoke advice and support services.
