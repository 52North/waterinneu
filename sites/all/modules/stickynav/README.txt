1) Put the module directory into sites/all/modules
folder in your Drupal installation.

2) Enable the module in admin/modules or using drush

3) Go to admin/config/user-interface/stickynav

4) Activate the themes you want a sticky navigation on

5) Place a jquery format selector into the Selector field for each activated

6) This may not look good on every theme. You might have to adjust the styling
to make it look good.
