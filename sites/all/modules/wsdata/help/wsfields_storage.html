<p>Defines a field storage controller which uses the CRUD operations defined in a wsconfig to interact with remote data using Drupal Fields.</p>

<p>Caveat.
Since the field module caches loaded field data, you should use the provided cache backend for fields.
You can do this by adding the following to your settings.php file, updated to reflect the location of wsfields_storage:

<pre>
$conf['cache_backends'][] = 'sites/all/modules/wsdata/modules/wsfields_storage/wsfields_storage.cache.inc';
</pre>
</p>
